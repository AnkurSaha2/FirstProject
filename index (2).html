        Even though there's nothing better than proper offline coaching, for just starting off or being unable to attend offline classes, there's plenty of free and paid online resources for you to learn from as well! For starters I would like to suggest watching all the videos of Gothamchess on YouTube for beginners, as he has explained all the much needed strategies and openings required to get started with lot's of humour as well ;) After that I'd suggest playing games on Chess.com, just to start applying those beginning principles that you've learnt. Soon, as you'll begin to get the feel of it, I'd suggest watching the more intermediate and advanced tutorial videos of Gothamchess and try to follow the  game analysis videos of his channel as from them, one will be able to learn the more advanced strategies that professional level chess player's apply on each and every move. After you feel that you're able to digest all of those advanced stuff, try playing games on lichess, and utilise their free principle practice, puzzle solving and game analysis features that will be helpful for you to improve your game in every stage of your chess life! Finally, once you feel that you're able to work out intermediate tactics in your games on your own, I'd suggest to practice naming the board coordinates quickly , using the free software provided on lichess as they become very helpful for you in the more advanced stages of calculating strategies and communicating about your moves with your fellow chess players. Finally, it's advised to practice atleast ten puzzles a day, to keep yourself updated upon new strategies that you can apply on your games.

          Dealing with Chess Rage

        We all know how difficult it is to handle chess rage whenever we make an obvious blunder or lose by time from a winning position!
        Infact, this is mostly the reason why most of the beginners quit playing chess, and that's exactly why I decided to talk about this first. Even though some of the best players of the world quite often suffer from this problem (which in most cases become quite obvious from their facial expressions and body language), this isn't something that we should let happen for ourselves, thinking that what works for the pros, would work for us too. Even though I used to face the same problem at the beginning of my chess obsession, I do not face any of it these days since I always look up at chess as a game and not something that reflects upon my overall capabilities as a human being :) So if you're suffering from this problem too, I'd suggest you to think about it in this way (or  in some other way that prevents you from overthinking and degrading your mental health.)
